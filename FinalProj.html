	<h1>Final Project 1.5.2</h1>
	
	<h1> Vegetation Vitality in Response to
		 Fracking and its Waste-water.
	</h1>
	
	<h2>This research aims to answer the question will plants serve as a decent proxy for 
		ground, and water-table pollution? Fracking waste waters contain chemicals not 
		suitable for human consumption. These waste-waters are both stored above ground (poorly) and 
		are injected into ground with the drill.
	</h2>
	
	<h2>This study ranges from June 2011 to June 2015 to capture plants in "full leaf", or at their greenest.
		Below are NDVI, or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, for 2 time periods.
		NDVI Calculation is ((NIR-Red)/(NIR+Red)). This calculation is used to create an NDVI image.
		The images displayed have a bit more math. NDVI on their own aren't as useful, so each image is now the difference,
		or change, in plant vitality between the two time periods.
		By convention, the healthiest plants will have the richest red, while areas void of plant life will be a vibrant green.
	</h2>
	
	<h2>The wells on the maps are marked and are contained within two buffer zones.
		The first buffer zone is a 100m radius around the well. Data within this circle should not be used
		in analysis. This buffer exists to eliminate the effects of construction and direct human interference.
		The second buffer, a 1km radius, is used to approximate the extent of any horizontal drilling.
		So the area of interest lies between both buffer zones. It is there that changes to plant health will be significant.

	<h2>The data is somewhat skewed in the year 2015 as the region experienced double the annual rainfall
		from the previous years in this study.
		Unfortunately the year 2014 could not be used as LandSat 5 passed over during a severe thunderstorm 
		and only captured cloud cover. LandSat 7 had monumental sensor failure and the data was unusable.
		LandSat 8 had not acquired data of the area in 2014.

			Oklahoma Geological Survey at University of Oklahoma for Well data.
			ESRI for their student trial of the ArcMap Software for which this would have
			otherwise been impossible.
